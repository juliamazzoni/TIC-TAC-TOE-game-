# Tic tac toe

This is the first game I developed while studying to become a software engineer. You should try it to have some fun with your friends and family and also to help me improving anything you think that could be better. Feedbacks are very welcome!

## About

This is a tic tac toe game with exactly the same rules as any tic tac toe game. In this game you have two players using the same computer.

## Planning & Problem Solving

This is my plan before starting the project. 
The hardest part for me was definitely checking the combinations of the winning numbers. I've tried quite a few options, such as combinations of built-in functions (to hard to understand just now), if conditions with 8 possibilities, and finally the one that I liked the most (because I can fully understand and it's more efficient than the big if condition) the nested loop.

## Cool Tech 

- html
- css
- Javascript
- google-fonts 
- animations from animate.style

## Bugs to fix 

As far as I know there are two bugs in this game I'm still trying to solve. And I believe I'm nearly there!

-   When a player wins, it's supposed to change the background colors of the 3 win cells only. But if you click in more than 3 cells until get the 3 win cells, you'll see that all of the cells that have been clicked by the player will have the background color changed.

-   There is an issue in my draw condition also. If the player gets the 3 win cells only when clicking on the last cell available, it is both a draw and the player wins. I tried to add if the win condition is false into the draw condition but it did't work. 

## Lessons learnt

Tring to write the code by myself first before asking for help. It's harder but you realize that you're more capable than you think. 
Trying to use the simplest/longest way first before trying to write a more efficient code that you don't really fully understand. 

## Future features 

I would like to improve the CSS more and add more animations so the game can be more attractive.
